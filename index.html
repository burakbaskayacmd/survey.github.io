          <h2>Adidas Predator 20.3 LL</h2>
          <p>
            This is an improved version of Adidas Predator 20.3 IN, in which a slightly different design and set of technologies,
            borrowed in part from the top version. Let's list the main chips of this model: 
            Seamless Purecut Technology
            top coat from Controlskin;
            elastic Sockfit panel instead of lacing;
            cushioning under the EVA heel.
            This version is more suitable for outdoor games, but also suitable for playing in the hall for those who want a futsal
            without laces. It feels like they are a cross between the Predator 20.3 and the Predator Mutator 20+, where there is
            more advantage in favor of a cheap variation.
